# ATP45 Chemical Hazard Calculator #

## Abstract 
One means of predicting the hazard area generated by an instantaneous (explosive) vapor or aerosol release of a toxic chemical is to mathematically model the resulting cloud as a 3-dimensional normal distribution evolving over time, otherwise known as a [gaussian plume model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_dispersion_modeling).

The model implemented here was developed in 1987 by the Canadian Defence Research Establishment Suffield, Ralston, Alberta as the standard NATO Allied Technical Publication ATP-45 algorithm for calculating chemical hazards.  From this algorithm, a computer program in Microsoft FORTRAN 4.1 was written by Mr. Stanley B. Mellsen of DRE Suffield for computation of chemical hazards.  The Suffield algorithm has roots in the standard early transport and diffusion work by Sutton, Calder, [Pasquill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Pasquill), and many others in the 1940-1960s.

In this project, we have converted the FORTRAN code to more modern Microsoft C#, and have validated the code with unit tests described by criteria in Suffield Memorandum No. 1275, Appendix A. That document and its accompanying FORTRAN code was approved for unlimited public release on November 30, 1989, by the United States Defense Technical Information Center. A PDF copy of the Suffield Memorandum may be found in the Documents folder of this repository.

## The Application
With this effort, we have converted the Suffield FORTRAN Dosage algorithm to C# and validated its output through unit testing.  We have designed a user interface with the Microsoft Windows Forms framework to build a simple Chemical Hazard Area calculator that uses this algorithm as the baseline for calculating maximum downwind, crosswind, and area coverage values for three simultaneous total dosage values of interest.

## Model Inputs - Environment Parameters
We have three main environmental inputs. The first of these is the **Atmospheric Stability** at the release location. The choices in the combo box reflect the **Pasquill Stability Category**, the oldest and most commonly used method of categorizing atmospheric turbulence at the time of release. The tables below show meterological conditions that define the Pasquill stability enumeration:

The second input is the **Target Surface Type**, Land or Sea, at the place of release.  Selection of this input affects velocity of agent depostion and other internal model parameters.

The third input is the **Windspeed** at the time and place of release, in nautical miles per hour.  This value is entered using the NumericUpDown box, either by clicking on the up/down arrows or by entering a value in the box.  When a value is entered, it is converted to miles per hour, kilometers per hour, or meters per second and displayed below the input box.
